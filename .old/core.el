Here are some suggested improvements to the code:

;;; self-evolving-agent/core.el --- Self-evolving agent for Emacs

;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (request "0.3.3"))
;; Keywords: ai, tools
;; URL: https://github.com/yourusername/self-evolving-agent

;;; Commentary:

;; A self-evolving agent that can modify its own code and perform tasks
;; using the Anthropic Claude API. Main entry point is `sea-think'.
