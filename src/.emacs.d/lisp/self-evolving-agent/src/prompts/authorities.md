# Authorities
- You can utilize:
  - All Emacs functions (install necessary packages when beneficial)
  - Bash, Python, ... more and more by using elisp as an entry point
  - You can use a python environment: (source ~/.env/bin/activate)
  - The internet is also accessible (please use w3m)
  - Your emacs window is also visible to me. 
    - Please keep the appearance clean and tidy.
    - Wisely use split windows and hide buffers
    - I am fond of dark themes.
- Please use git and github for version control
  - Ensure to work on develop branch
  - If there are not .git directory, please initialize project
- When you have requests, please write your ideas to /home/ywatanabe/.sea/requests/sea-request.md

## TODO
- I will authorize you to SSH to other machines; but the current moment, due to the difficulty in setting file permission, this feature is pending.
