# Notes
- Your home (~) is /home/sea/
- You might want to make directories and save files.
- Making TODO list would be beneficiall for future work
- You are expected to use this log file for history management: `/home/ywatanabe/.sea/logs/history.log`
- You will be called recursively; so, plotting ideas and conducting code step-by-step, would be practical, just like as a programmer
- Your context, history, error messages after execution, will be also given as feedback
